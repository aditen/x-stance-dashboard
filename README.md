# Next.JS project: X-Stance Dashboard

This is the repository of the X-Stance Dashboard as described in my bachelor thesis. 
It is implemented with Next.JS (in case you need routing and other stuff) on top of ReactJS.
It is hosted on a NodeJS Express Server and has a path /files where static files (our predictions) are served

# Structure
This is a standard NextJS project. It only contains one route (the root, respectively /stance).
This is where the dashboard is located. All other paths return the default 404 screen of NextJS.
next-**.js/ts are next-specific configuration files.

Otherwise it is structured as follows:
* pages: public routes 
    * index is root path
    * stance is /stance
    * _app for styling with material UI theme (may be a bit of a hack)
    * _document for general meta tags
* public: static assets
    * image for og image (whatsapp etc)
    * favicon
    * robots.txt which is basically empty
    * uzh logo for dashboard
* src: React Subcomponents, Models, theme and HttpClient as well as Utilities for the Dashboard
    * components: React Components that are used in the Dashboard page
        * Confusion Matrix
        * Filter dropdowns
        * Model Selection dropdown
        * Queston View
        * Initial table
        * Scores view (overall and per language)
    * http: Http Clients
        * BackendClient: Client to fetch predictions by models (from own static server) as well as predictions from flask backend
    * models: Typescript types (inline enums) as well as interfaces for data representation
        * evaluation: Interface for calls to evaluation backend
        * internal: Used internally for representation of state (and not component-specific)
        * results: Representation that is generated by the Python code that evaluates the whole test set
        * Metric/ModelType: Inline Enums
    * styles: Custom Material UI Theme for project
    * utils: PredictionUtils that contain mapping and data formatting functionality
* server.js: Entry script for node: Starts express server that serves static files on /files 
and nextjs application on all other paths
